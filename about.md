#### About this website
As mentioned above I'm writing my BA thesis on **The future of news**. I would not call this site a blog because I'm not writing full articles. It's more like a personal – digitalized – Moleskine. A list of links, resourses and quotes I gather aroud the www in one unique place. I always tried to mention the source and the author: if I missed something plaese don't hesitate to write me.

#### Colophone
This website is made with Jekyll and Pixyll Theme. Fonts are served with Typekit. Post are usually written with Sublime Text 2.
