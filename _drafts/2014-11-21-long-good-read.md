In an on-line world full of contents we tend to consume news superficially. That's a fact. But, as the third law of motion declares, for every action there is an equal and opposite reaction. And the reaction to nowadays news consumption is _long form journalism_.

Many are the projects that target an audience angry for long reads. And apparently people tend to spend more and more time on long-form stories despite of on breaking – and very short – news. 

For example at The Guardian – the former developer [Dan Catt](#) – developed an algorithm capable of collecting the most interesting stories every day. Once the robot finished its work an editor will review and select the most relevant ones. And finally the selected stories will be placed on a weekly newspaper proudly printed and delivered by the [Newspaper Club](#) every Monday at the [#guardiancoffee](#). That is the __Long Good Read__ project.

Another interesting project is [Longform.org](#). A website and an iOS application that recommends new and classic non-fiction from around the web. The stories are collected from the databases of saved articles in read-later services such us Instapaper, Readability and Pocket. Why? In the words of its co-founder:

>"I think people are motivated by a desire to read incredible stories, when they want to and how they want to."
— Aaron Lammer

Longform is not the only service which aims at collecting the best stories around the web. Also [Longreads.com](#) tries to accomplish this goal. Mark Armstrong, the creator of Long Reads, wants to let people share stories that are valuable and that can help publisher survive:

>"Twitter and Facebook are critical to driving traffic for publishers, and people like to share stories that are thoughtful or unique. These stories are a bit more evergreen than breaking news – they live longer lives and get passed around." 



Unlike many Web sites that link to other content from their articles, links will not be embedded in the Nomad Editions content, but it will support multimedia like video and audio.
