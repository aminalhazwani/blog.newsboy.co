#### Tl;dr
A mobile application that help reporters create and promote small video teaser of their most valuable stories.

#### Why a app?
Every journalist can create the promo video and promote his/her own story. My goal is to help newsrooms spread their work even if they do not have a video or a social-media team. No video skills are required. The aim is to achieve the best user experience possible. 

Moreover, making a promo video is a 5 minutes time investment. The result helps newsrooms grow and gain new readers. In my opinion, before investing money in an interactive story or in brand new design, newspapers should have a consolidated audience. Because it is that audience, it is their fidelity, that will help the newspaper in the future to spread its latest interactive stories or its re-designed website. 

Readers are not normally particularly aware of the graphic look of the newspaper they hold in their hands or the news website they look at. But, when it changes they notice right away and complain vociferously. Newspapers readers would seem to be the world's most conservative audience.[^1]

This is not always true. For instance let me take as example Internazionale Magazine. Internazionale has a very strong fidelity with its readers and every time a new feature is implemented the audience answer to it with useful suggestion and further possible improvements. 

So, I truly believe that this social-video-promotion app can contribute to bring new readers. Through showing them interesting stories and trying to build a relationship with them. 

#### Why a video?
It is widely acclaimed that videos are much more engaging than classical articles headlines. Moreover video content was and is the key-success of news and entertainment websites such us Vice, BuzzFeed and Huntington Post.

Many are the start-ups that have built their product on video. For example there is Wochit which allows reporter to create and edit videos directly in the browser. With also the possibility of taking some recorded content from the best news agencies such us AP, Gettyimages and Reuters. Or another one is Stringwire. Which allows reporters to stream real time content. The content comes the users' devices which are directly streaming from the field.

Moreover making a small video will offer journalists something which is already optimized for distribution on social media networks.[^2]

Take as example the success of Vine (an application which allows you to record and share 6 seconds video). Consuming and watching videos is really engaging. And this is one of the reason that has brought Instagram on adding a video option to their app. Or even Facebook that now auto-plays video (without audio) in your Newsfeed.

#### Why social networks?
Social networks – and especially Facebook – are the main source of readers for news websites. I would strongly suggest reporters to share their video-stories on Instragram and share them easily on Facebook with my app. Why? Because now every news platform use Facebook to promote its content and it is very difficult to have the users attention among all these static and not so attractive headline titles. But why Instagram? Young people do not use Facebook anymore and in my opinion it is important to share interesting news stories with a new target.

#### Why a new target? 
The aim of this strategy is trying to make the news gap[^3] thinner.

#### Why a video for written content?
As said before video is really engaging. To support my thesis I would like to show here some really nice examples of social video promotion.

In the news field IL Magazine, the monthly magazine by most famous finance newspaper Il Sole 24 Ore, art directed by Francesco Franchi, usually creates a promo video for their upcoming new number:

<blockquote class="instagram-media" data-instgrm-version="4" style=" background:#FFF; border:0; border-radius:3px; box-shadow:0 0 1px 0 rgba(0,0,0,0.5),0 1px 10px 0 rgba(0,0,0,0.15); margin: 1px; max-width:658px; padding:0; width:99.375%; width:-webkit-calc(100% - 2px); width:calc(100% - 2px);"><div style="padding:8px;"> <div style=" background:#F8F8F8; line-height:0; margin-top:40px; padding:50% 0; text-align:center; width:100%;"> <div style=" background:url(data:image/png;base64,iVBORw0KGgoAAAANSUhEUgAAACwAAAAsCAMAAAApWqozAAAAGFBMVEUiIiI9PT0eHh4gIB4hIBkcHBwcHBwcHBydr+JQAAAACHRSTlMABA4YHyQsM5jtaMwAAADfSURBVDjL7ZVBEgMhCAQBAf//42xcNbpAqakcM0ftUmFAAIBE81IqBJdS3lS6zs3bIpB9WED3YYXFPmHRfT8sgyrCP1x8uEUxLMzNWElFOYCV6mHWWwMzdPEKHlhLw7NWJqkHc4uIZphavDzA2JPzUDsBZziNae2S6owH8xPmX8G7zzgKEOPUoYHvGz1TBCxMkd3kwNVbU0gKHkx+iZILf77IofhrY1nYFnB/lQPb79drWOyJVa/DAvg9B/rLB4cC+Nqgdz/TvBbBnr6GBReqn/nRmDgaQEej7WhonozjF+Y2I/fZou/qAAAAAElFTkSuQmCC); display:block; height:44px; margin:0 auto -44px; position:relative; top:-22px; width:44px;"></div></div><p style=" color:#c9c8cd; font-family:Arial,sans-serif; font-size:14px; line-height:17px; margin-bottom:0; margin-top:8px; overflow:hidden; padding:8px 0 7px; text-align:center; text-overflow:ellipsis; white-space:nowrap;"><a href="https://instagram.com/p/wg-AXFqJpg/" style=" color:#c9c8cd; font-family:Arial,sans-serif; font-size:14px; font-style:normal; font-weight:normal; line-height:17px; text-decoration:none;" target="_top">A video posted by Francesco Franchi (@ffranchi)</a> on <time style=" font-family:Arial,sans-serif; font-size:14px; line-height:17px;" datetime="2014-12-12T17:31:27+00:00">Dec 12, 2014 at 9:31am PST</time></p></div></blockquote>
<script async defer src="//platform.instagram.com/en_US/embeds.js"></script>

Or another interesting example is Time Magazine:

<blockquote class="instagram-media" data-instgrm-captioned data-instgrm-version="4" style=" background:#FFF; border:0; border-radius:3px; box-shadow:0 0 1px 0 rgba(0,0,0,0.5),0 1px 10px 0 rgba(0,0,0,0.15); margin: 1px; max-width:658px; padding:0; width:99.375%; width:-webkit-calc(100% - 2px); width:calc(100% - 2px);"><div style="padding:8px;"> <div style=" background:#F8F8F8; line-height:0; margin-top:40px; padding:50% 0; text-align:center; width:100%;"> <div style=" background:url(data:image/png;base64,iVBORw0KGgoAAAANSUhEUgAAACwAAAAsCAMAAAApWqozAAAAGFBMVEUiIiI9PT0eHh4gIB4hIBkcHBwcHBwcHBydr+JQAAAACHRSTlMABA4YHyQsM5jtaMwAAADfSURBVDjL7ZVBEgMhCAQBAf//42xcNbpAqakcM0ftUmFAAIBE81IqBJdS3lS6zs3bIpB9WED3YYXFPmHRfT8sgyrCP1x8uEUxLMzNWElFOYCV6mHWWwMzdPEKHlhLw7NWJqkHc4uIZphavDzA2JPzUDsBZziNae2S6owH8xPmX8G7zzgKEOPUoYHvGz1TBCxMkd3kwNVbU0gKHkx+iZILf77IofhrY1nYFnB/lQPb79drWOyJVa/DAvg9B/rLB4cC+Nqgdz/TvBbBnr6GBReqn/nRmDgaQEej7WhonozjF+Y2I/fZou/qAAAAAElFTkSuQmCC); display:block; height:44px; margin:0 auto -44px; position:relative; top:-22px; width:44px;"></div></div> <p style=" margin:8px 0 0 0; padding:0 4px;"> <a href="https://instagram.com/p/x3_1LXK6-l/" style=" color:#000; font-family:Arial,sans-serif; font-size:14px; font-style:normal; font-weight:normal; line-height:17px; text-decoration:none; word-wrap:break-word;" target="_top">TIME&#39;s new cover: After Paris. &#39;Charlie Hebdo,&#39; radicalism and what&#39;s next for terrorism.

<script async defer src="//platform.instagram.com/en_US/embeds.js"></script>

Or the Guardian that has crated a Vine video on the launch day of their new website:

<iframe class="vine-embed" src="https://vine.co/v/OT2DuqXagEz/embed/postcard?audio=1" width="600" height="600" frameborder="0"></iframe><script async src="//platform.vine.co/static/scripts/embed.js" charset="utf-8"></script>

This examples show how you can potentially use an existing tool to promote your content and engage new users.

There are also some other interesting examples of smart promotion through what is offered by social networks, especially in the advertising field. For example the Instagram campaign by Ikea's new furniture collection:

Or the fun "scrolling" campaign by Uniquo on Pinterest:
