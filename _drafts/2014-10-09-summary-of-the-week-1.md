#### Ideas of the week
Started from something [I wrote this week](http://thesis.aminalhazwani.com/who-do-you-trust/) I thought about what would be like if the reader could rate the credibility of a news article. What if the reader could rate the credibility of a journalist? 

That idea evolved in something else. What would be like if a news article works like a git repository. What would be like if a reader can "fork" the article. Is the journalist enough open to accept changes to his article if someone else make it better?

#### Tools for media analysis

Media attention matters â€“ in quantity and quality. It helps determine what we talk about as a public and how we talk about it.

What was covered in the news this week? Did the issues you care about get the attention you think they deserved? Did the media talk about these topics in the way you want them to? Who set the narrative for the current breaking story?

What does it mean to be a citizen in the digital age?

Build tools and systems that help communities collect and share information and connect that information to action.
We particularly focus on tools that can help amplify the voices of communities often excluded from the digital public sphere and connect them with new audiences, as well as on systems that help us understand media ecologies, augment civic participation, and foster digital inclusion.<br>

The tools that the audience have, to inform one another: that's citizen journalism.

#### Papers of the week
[Russian Blogs as an Alternative Public Sphere](http://papers.ssrn.com/sol3/papers.cfm?abstract_id=2427932)<br> "We conclude that blogs provide an alternative public sphere: a space for civic discussion and organization that differs significantly from that provided by the mainstream media, TV, and government."
