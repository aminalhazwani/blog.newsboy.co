summary:    When the information preferences of the media and the public diverge.
---

John Zaller has written that journalists "want to be freed form the subservience to the mass audience, so that they can provide the public with the kind of news they ... feel the public needs".[^1]

Studies have shown that journalists are more influenced by other news workers, such as editors, peers, and competitors, than by the the preference of their audiences.[^2]

Some analysts have argued that the content of news stories isn't the main factor in whether the audiece aquires information, and that the main factor is the format in which stories are dissaminated. [^3]

They have suggested that novels formats, such as talk shows and feature-style storytelling, may help to convey political public-affairs news to otherwise inattentive consumers.[^4]

Scholars and commentators have suggested that "softer" news formats have been on the rise in recent decades.[^5]
