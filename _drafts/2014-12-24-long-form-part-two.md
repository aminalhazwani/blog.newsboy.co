After the well established work of the New York Times – namely Snowfall – I found another award winning project by NPR. It is developed by the their [Visual Team](http://blog.apps.npr.org/) and it shows the world behind the making of a t-shirt in five chapters full of video, graphics and pictures. To view more visit [planetmoney.com/shirt](http://planetmoney.com/shirt).

Worth to mention NPR shares the source code of every project on [GitHub](https://github.com/nprapps) providing also instructions on how to run each app on your machine. Chapeau!
