summary:    The format in which news is disseminated has now become crucial for conveying political information to a largely inattentive public. 
---

While reading the J. Boczkowski book "The News Gap" I learned that readers are not interested in public-affairs stories but are more willing to read stories about sports, crime, entertainment, and weather. The only exception is during periods of heightened political activity where the percentage of public-affairs topics in their news diet grows.

The format in which news is disseminated has now become crucial for conveying political information to a largely inattentive public.[^1]

On this trend USA TODAY has developed an interesting project in order to send nation's news to their readers. With the [YO](http://justyo.co/) app users can subscribe to USATODAY "5 things to know today". Moreover they created two other subscription list such as YOGOP and YODEMS for-real time results about the 2014 presidential campaign. 

Don't know Yo? Yo is the zero-character communications app that has puzzled and amused mobile users since its debut this past spring. At its base, users communicate with contacts a single, audible "Yo!" — no text-based "hi," no "lol," no "smh." Over the summer, outside developers were racing to find uses for it and businesses were buying in. The result: the Yo Index, a growing directory of services that "yo" in creative ways to connect with mobile audiences.[^2]

Another interesting project from USATODAY is YOUR TAKE. Your Take puts readers at the center of the news. They can add their videos and photos to any article, or contribute  with their own story using the USATODAY iPhone app or Your Take on USATODAY.com.[^3]

As I state in the abstract of my thesis, news are not only available on laptops and smartphones, but on a new range of devices such as smartwatches and smart-TVs. Developers at NPR have embraced this trend right away: during the mid-term US elections they created a web-app –[ Election Party 2014!](http://elections.npr.org/) – where the audience could find a clear overview of the voting process plus a real-time comment coming from the NPR newsroom. Moreover, they gave the possibility of streaming the content of the web-app via Google Chromecast to a smart-TV.

Another interesting approach is the one offered by [Hash](http://thehash.today/). A photo/tweets aggregator hashtag driver. There are list related to public-affairs such us #Yemen, #BokoHaram and #CharlieHebdo but also trendy like #AustralianOpen or Popular Selfies.

In order to be rightfully inspired we could also mention some interesting social campaigns that have made a smart use of social media platform such us Instagram or Pinterest. 

In order to promote its new collection in Russia Ikea has created a "website" within an Instagram profile. Tags work as links between the different product pages and products pictures. Moreover, user can upload a their product image as well using the right hashtag.

Worth to mention also Uniqulo that has developed a really smart Ad campaign through its Pinterest profile.
