What is a newsgame? As [Tomas Rawling](http://gamethenews.net/) says a newsgame is about engagement and it is not necessarily fun. It has to be topical but respecting the source material. It has to be gamic, palyful, interactive but not necessarily a game. You should deliver more than just straight gameplay.

If news organisation are not making use of the interactivity in this devices (smartphones, tablets, etc., Ed.) then the output they produce would become increasingly stale next to this (Candy Crush, Netflix, etc., Ed.) more elaborate interactions. 

The purpose of newsgame is to read and hear about the stories that matter. As media consumption evolves, most major outlets are looking into quizzes and games that can accompany traditional coverage. [^1] Why? Because newsgame can generate high levels of engagment. They are able to put you in someone else shoes.

Games are usually identified as fun and therefore fun thigs aren't serious. 
Why don't we use games as primary medium. We can experience somenthing which is far from us. game is a non-linear medium.

As Mr. Rawling says in the TEDx talk games are not only about entertaimnet. He shows valuable examples where gamers organized a protest in a game. They took the problem very seriosly and they orginezed themself.
