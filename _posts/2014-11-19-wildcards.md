[Wildcard](http://www.trywildcard.com/) is an application which tries to solve the problem of mobile digital media consumption. If on one hand the mobile web offers many advantanges like indexable content and search features on the other itâ€™s painfully slow to interact with, and it's difficult to optimize when building web products. As a result consumers are spending more and more time inside of mobile apps. 

This is statistically proved by [comScore](http://www.comscore.com/Insights/Presentations-and-Whitepapers/2014/The-US-Mobile-App-Report) and [Flurry Analytics](http://www.comscore.com/Insights/Presentations-and-Whitepapers/2014/The-US-Mobile-App-Report). People tend to not use the browser on their mobile devices. 

That's why Wildcard was born. The aim is to develop a system of cards able to bring the benefits of the browser, like indexability of the content, to the world of applications. It makes good use of a native component, the Card, which is a well structure data that can direct users to a source app through deep-linking. For example an article card displays media content and allows a user to subscribe.
