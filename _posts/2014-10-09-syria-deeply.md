Today I watched the talk of Lara at [re:publica 2014](http://re-publica.de/en/14). She is one of the founder of [Syria Deeply](http://www.syriadeeply.org/).

Syria Deeply is – in the words from their website – an independent digital media project led by journalists and technologists that explores a new model of storytelling around a global crisis. 

In this talk Lara is going to show how the project was born, what are the results and how is going to proceed.

Here some interesting points from the video:

- Inspiration from [Reality is Broken](http://www.amazon.it/Reality-Broken-Games-Better-Change-ebook/dp/B004NBZFS4/ref=sr_1_1?ie=UTF8&qid=1412874019&sr=8-1&keywords=reality+is+broken) by Jane McGonigal
- "If you try to put a roof over a story, what it would look like?"
- One story, one landing page. But the best user experience possible. It is a content architecture exercise.
- Why collecting different sources? Try to collectively watch  tweets about a topic. Those tweets have a really high value. They have a predictive effect and it's more comprehensive.
- Hack the news cycle: engine for covering the story.
- "You left television to build a website"
- Single subject news model
- Journalists became entrepreneurs
