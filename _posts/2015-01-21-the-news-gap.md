summary:    When the information preferences of the media and the public diverge.
---

I just finished to read the work of Boczkowski: "The News Gap". It was very interesting to discover and understand what readers usually read and why. How people change their news diet depending on the actual socio-political situation. And what journalists are willing to talk about. Talking about reporters John Zaller has written that journalists "want to be freed form the subservience to the mass audience, so that they can provide the public with the kind of news they ... feel the public needs".[^1] But on the contrary many are the tools that try to understand the readers habits in order to help newsroom nad reporters to write more about what people want and less about of what people need. Being on-line advertising the main source of profits for digital newsroom every new click means more income. 

But there are also studies that have shown that journalists are more influenced by other news workers, such as editors, peers, and competitors, than by the the preference of their audiences.[^2] This is something I noticed too. And it is one of the starting point of my thesis project

>[...] But today, news are consumed on devices that are interactive by their nature. You can read on your iPad, smart TV, Android phone and soon on your smartwatch. So, __nowadays not only are newspapers competing with each other__, but mainly with a whole new world of applications – like Candy Crush or Netflix – that are making full use of the interactivity provided by these devices.

Nonetheless content is the only circumstance that affects the preferences of news readers. Some analysts have argued that the content of news stories isn't the main factor in whether the audience acquires information, and that the main factor is the format in which stories are disseminated. [^3] This is an interesting statement because shifts the focus from content to form. And as a designer is something where I can contribute to with my knowledge. They have suggested that novels formats, such as talk shows and feature-style storytelling, may help to convey political public-affairs news to otherwise inattentive consumers.[^4] Moreover scholars and commentators have suggested that "softer" news formats have been on the rise in recent decades.[^5] And as I write in the abstract of my thesis recent scholarship has shown that audiences tend to privilege entertainment over news.[^6] So as designer I must intervene and help newsrooms with new engaging tools because media seem to be talking to themselves and to the political and economic elites, rather than to their broad base of consumers.[^7]

Going back to news content it appears that at least for on-line news, audiences behave as "monitorial citizens," increasing the percentage of public-affairs topics in their news diet during periods of heightened political activity.[^8] But storytelling formats appear to be largely independent of variations in the sociopolitical context. This demonstrates that storytelling preferences are more stable than thematic preferences for both journalist and consumers.[^9] An that's why the format in which news is disseminated has now become crucial for conveying political information to a largely inattentive public.[^10]

No matter what but content appears to be the king in digital age.[^11]
