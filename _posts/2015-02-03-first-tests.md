During the last meeting with my relators we decided to try ourselves to produce small promo video from real news content. While we were talking we cited [Salto.bz](http://salto.bz/it), which is a open and social online newspaper in South-Tirol. I looked for an interesting article and I tried to create a Gif with Photoshop.

The article I chose is "[OpenStreetMap: das Wikipedia der Landkarten](http://www.salto.bz/article/16012015/openstreetmap-das-wikipedia-der-landkarten)" and this was the first Gif I created:

But then I realized that before pushing with colors and styles I should concentrate on the content and on how to better structure the video. This is the second test I made starting from the same article:

But I still wasn't happy the result. The problem – I thinks – was with the content. The article I chose was too short. And this is when I understood that my application is meant to be used for long quality stories. Stories that are worth investing time in promotion. Web journalist tend to write even 10 articles per day, but this article are very short and the timing is really an issue in digital newsroom.

So, I started looking for more structured long articles. I searched for reportages on Internazionale website and I found this: "[Seimila euro per essere abbandonati in mezzo al mare](http://www.internazionale.it/reportage/2015/01/13/seimila-euro-per-essere-abbandonati-in-mezzo-al-mare)" and by simply taking the title and the images already present in the article I created this small mp4 video with Photoshop:

<video width="320" height="320" controls>
<source src="/assets/00_Internazionale_rifugiati.mp4" type="video/mp4">
</video>

The result is very similar to a teaser, just a sneak peak of the content.

After this step I tried to create a more structure video, more similar to a trailer. With an introduction, which is the title, a development and a conclusion. Also here texts and pictures were already present in the article. 

<video width="320" height="320" controls>
<source src="/assets/01_Internazionale_neofascisti.mp4" type="video/mp4">
</video>

During the making of this last video I thought about a possible timing approach. As you can see certain slide are just too fast and they are impossible to be red. It would be interesting to set automatically the duration of each text slide based on the length of the text inside it.

Concerning timing would be interesting also to set a standard duration for images or other similar content which are not text or video. In this way it would be easier and faster for the journalist to build up his or her promo video.

Talking about styling I understood that having the control over the typography helps a lot the final result. Another possible direction is to style the video based on the color palette of the newspaper as you can see from the last examples for Internazionale. By just using the colors of their logo – yellow and blue – the final result is very close to their corporate identity even if I haven't used their brand fonts.
