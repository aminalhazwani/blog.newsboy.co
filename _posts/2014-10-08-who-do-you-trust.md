While looking at the promo video of the [Newseum](http://www.newseum.org/) program "The Future of News" I noticed how they address the issue of credebility of a newspaper or the liability of a journalist. This is somenthing which is really common in politics. 

A worth to mention example is [politifact.com](http://www.politifact.com/) which is an indipendent fast-checking journalism website aimed at bringing you the truth in politics. The whole website is based on a tool called "Truth-o-meter" which underline if a fact is true, half-true or false.

Would be interesting to develop something similar but for news, a sort of **news checking** where maybe is the reader who says if a certain news is true or false and why.
