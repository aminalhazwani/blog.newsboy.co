Regret the error is a blog written by [Craig Silverman](https://twitter.com/craigsilverman) that runs on [Poynter.com](http://www.poynter.org/). The blog reports on media errors and corrections, and trends regarding accuracy and verification.

This is a very interesting topic because with the advent of digital news making changes and correction is effortless. But how digital media are documenting the changes? Or better, are they documenting them? If yes, how? Mr. Silverman keeps [a list](http://www.poynter.org/news/mediawire/306801/the-year-in-media-errors-and-corrections-2014/) of the best corrections and he shows how every news platform handle it. 

He also wrote a [verification handbook](http://verificationhandbook.com/) which is a guide on verifying digital content, especially user generated one(UGD). This, of course, will help news agency and reporters to verify their sources and avoid possible mistakes.
