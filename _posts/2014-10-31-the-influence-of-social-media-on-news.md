#### How facebook is changing the way its users consume journalism
→ [New York Times](http://www.nytimes.com/2014/10/27/business/media/how-facebook-is-changing-the-way-its-users-consume-journalism.html?smid=fb-nytimes&smtyp=cur&bicmp=AD&bicmlukp=WT.mc_id&bicmst=1409232722000&bicmet=1419773522000&_r=0)

Facebook is increasingly becoming to the news business what Amazon is to book publishing.

Just as the music industry has moved largely from selling albums to songs bought instantly online, publishers are increasingly reaching readers through individual pieces rather than complete editions of newspapers or magazines. A publication’s home page, said Edward Kim, a co-founder of SimpleReach, will soon be important more as an advertisement of its brand than as a destination for readers.

Facebook officials say that the more time users spend at its site, the more likely there will be a robust exchange of diverse viewpoints and ideas shared online.

Ben Smith, editor in chief of BuzzFeed, a news and entertainment site, said his rule for writing and reporting in a fragmented age is simple: **“no filler.”** News organizations that still publish a print edition, he said, have slots — physical holes on paper or virtual ones on a home page — that result in the publication of stories that are not necessarily the most interesting or timely, but are required to fill the space. It was partly to discourage such slot-filling that BuzzFeed did not focus on its home page when it first started, he said.

The question that older publications that are not “digital natives” like BuzzFeed have to ask themselves, Mr. Kim said, is 

> “Are you creating content for the way that content is consumed in this environment?”

“We’re asking if there’s a different kind of storytelling, not just an ideal presentation,” she said. For instance, she said, people reading The Post on a mobile phone during the day will probably want a different kind of reading experience than those who are on a Wi-Fi connection at home in the evening.


#### How social media is reshaping the news

Facebook is the obvious news powerhouse among the social media sites.

Half of social network site users have shared news stories, images or videos , and nearly as many  (46%) have discussed a news issue or event. In addition to sharing news on social media, a small number are also covering the news themselves, by posting photos or videos of news events. 

Facebook is an important source of website referrals for many news outlets, but the users who arrive via Facebook spend far less time and consume far fewer pages than those who arrive directly. The same is true of users arriving by search.

Visitors who go to a news media website directly spend roughly three times as long as those who wind up there through search or Facebook, and they view roughly five times as many pages per month. 

Our recent survey revealed social media doesn’t always facilitate conversation around the important issues of the day. In fact, we found people were less willing to discuss their opinion on the Snowden-NSA story on social media than they were in person.


#### Social, Search and Direct

This higher level of engagement from direct visitors holds true across the full mix of sites studied.

The strategy of Buzzfeed, for example, is very different from that of traditional news organizations. It is not built around building a loyal, returning audience. Instead, it is built around “being a part of the conversation”.

For organizations producing news content, what may be most critical is how much they understand about these different audience pathways and the degree to which their strategies – both in terms of content and revenue – match their audience flow.

Users who navigate directly to news sites provide the highest percentage of traffic to online news content. Users who navigate directly also deliver the highest levels of engagement on these sites, as measured by time spent, number of pages viewed and visits per month.

To some degree, these levels of engagement reflect the different user experiences connected to each type of path. Visitors using search engines tend to be looking for a particular story or content on a specific topic, and may be less concerned about the source of the story. On Facebook, news use tends to be more of a random and “incidental” experience.

News consumers who arrive on sites by typing in URLs or by clicking on bookmarks are likely to already have some connection with that news brand, which may explain the significantly higher levels of engagement.

A Fall 2012 report found that on a smartphone, 61% of mobile news users got news “mostly” from their mobile browsers vs. 28% “mostly” from apps.

For the majority of sites studied here, visitors coming from Facebook were younger than visitors coming to the site directly or through search. This was true for both 18- to 24- year-olds and 25- to 34-year-olds.
