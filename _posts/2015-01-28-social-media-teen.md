I recently red an interesting [article on Medium by Andrew Watts](https://medium.com/backchannel/a-teenagers-view-on-social-media-1df945c09ac6). An actual teen from Texas. Why do I underline "actual teen"? Because Andre's article title is "A Teenager’s View on Social Media. Written by an actual teen."

Through his article Andrew gave us a clear and humble overview on how teenagers see and use social media. His article received a lot of attention and was across several news platform cited. The success of his article is due to his honesty and direct opinion on social networks. 

Despite what are the most common beliefs real teenagers are not big fan of Facebook and they use it only if it is really strictly necessary. 

>In short, many have nailed this on the head. It’s dead to us. Facebook is something we all got in middle school because it was cool but now is seen as an awkward family dinner party we can't really leave. 

The winner is Instagram and this is something I would like to keep in mind during my thesis development. Considering also the recent read "The News Gap" I am looking for possible solution that would make this gap thinner. 

>Instagram is by far the most used social media outlet for my age group. Please note the verbiage there—it is the most used social media outlet. Meaning, although the most people are on Facebook, we actually post stuff on Instagram. 

As already mentioned in the previous post [Promote news through new social media ideas](http://thesis.aminalhazwani.com/social-media-ideas/) there are plenty of possibility offered by this platforms. We need just to use them in a smart way.

Andrew has also written another [article](https://medium.com/backchannel/what-teens-really-think-about-youtube-google-reddit-and-other-social-media-a7263924a506), the part two, about the social networks he has not listed in the previous article.
