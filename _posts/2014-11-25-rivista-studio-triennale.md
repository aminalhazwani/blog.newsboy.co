Last Sunday I spent the afternoon at [Triennale Design Museum](http://www.triennale.org/it/triennale-design-museum) attending a very interesting event organized by [Rivista Studio](http://www.rivistastudio.com/articoli/il-programma-di-studio-in-triennale/). The main topic of the day was Media and Tech. 

At the beginning there was an terrific keynote of [Thomas Smolders](https://twitter.com/ljosmyndun), the 23 years old strategist of [Blendle](https://blendle.nl/), a Holland startup that has a business model similar to the iTunes Store. You pay just for the articles you want to read. No subscription required. After his presentation Luca Sofri (editor in chief of _Il Post_), Daniele Bellasio (social media manager of _Sole 24 Ore_) and Beniamino Pagliaro (co-founder of the morning newsletter _Good Morning Italia_) joined the conversation taking about the future of news models for digital information. 

In my opinion the most interesting exchange within the conversation was when the guests talked about old and new media. In Sofri's point of view is stupid to make a distinction between old and new media since the major news website are run by the major print newspapers. Moreover news website that do not have a print version still rely on the content delivered by newspapers. Even though print journalism is facing a strong crisis its content is very relevant for digital media. What new news models should aim for is a stronger connection between print and digital where they can both helping each other in this world of information overload.
