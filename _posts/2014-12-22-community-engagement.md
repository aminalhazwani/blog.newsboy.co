While on one hand newsrooms search for new powerful data-analysis tools on the other there is a growing trend of journalists who seek for a stronger connection with their readers. Especially when we look at local newspapers.

Instead of looking at the data these type of journalists try to build up their work on their readers voices. A journalist as an active listener of the community. But local newspaper are fighting a strong crisis, even bigger than national media (as [stated by the Pew Research Center](http://www.journalism.org/packages/state-of-the-news-media-2014/)), but "It's not that people aren't interested in their communities" writes media reporter [Paul Farhi in the Washington Post](http://www.washingtonpost.com/lifestyle/style/charting-the-years-long-decline-of-local-news-reporting/2014/03/26/977bf088-b457-11e3-b899-20667de76985_story.html), "Local news usually ranks as the top priority in surveys  — it's that the economics of the digital age work strongly against reporting about schools, cops and the folks down the street."

What is needed is a place where people will talk about hard things when someone's listening and when they believe they can make a difference, even in a small way.[^1]

There are several initiatives that try to create a connection between the local newspapers and the communities. For example there is [The Listening Post](http://listeningpostnola.tumblr.com/About%20Listening%20Post%20NOLA) which is a community media  project that aims to start a conversation about local news in New Orleans. 

Or [GroundSource](http://beta.groundsourcing.com/), a sms-powered tool, which makes it easier to talk to people who aren't on social media or don't have reliable access to the internet. You, as a journalist, ask a simple question and use the answers to target follow-up and build groups with shared demographics or experience. Once the groups are segmented the app will help you targeting your future questions in order to get better answers.

Furthermore there is [Public Insight Network](https://www.publicinsightnetwork.org/) a platform where people can share knowledge and insights with journalists, helping them cover the the news in greater depth and uncover stories they might not otherwise find.[^2]

While looking forward for non-traditional way of community engagement I found this interesting article on medium: [Five Kinds of Listening for Newsrooms and Communities](https://medium.com/the-local-news-lab/five-kinds-of-listening-for-newsrooms-and-communities-67c373c25df8). The author, John Stearns, tries to list five models for listening:
    - Listening to sources and interviewees: pay attention to the source who make up our stories.
    - Listening for story ideas: a good journalist should listen to their communites to discover new story ideas.
    - Listening for feedback: once a story is published newsrooms should seek for community feedback.
    - Listening for understanding the context.
    - Listening for relationships: try not only to engage but to  build a relationship based on trust, empathy, transparency and accountability.
