summary:    Some ideas for advancing journalistic video as automated production, live steamed user-generated footage, and thoughtful storytelling. 
---

On-line videos are one of the strongest forms of digital journalism. Using videos as main medium of their content was the "secret" success-key for news provider such us Vice and Buzzfeed. 

On this trend many are the platforms that try to automate the process of news related video. Because brands such us Vice and Buzzfeed have many many people in their video team and this is something that not all newsroom can afford. 

One of them is [Wochit](http://www.wochit.com/) which allows journalists to push out a video report along with an article in just 10 minutes. Users can create a short video about their story with content coming from news agency such us Reuters, Gettyimages or AP. You can edit the video as well, the UI is much simpler than Apple Final Cut or Adobe Premiere.

The reporter itself can produce and share the video and support his/her piece. As Wochit founder underlines

>journalists spend a lot of time writing great stories but how do you get that discovered. Video is shown exponentially that'll drive more engagement traffic.

and more

>if I had a quick summery video of an article I might consume the article a lot more.

Another interesting tool is [Stringwire](https://www.stringwire.com/) which push live user-generated footage to TV in real time.

The idea is to change what's possible during breaking news coverage. Multiple devices can stream multiple videos in real time. Newsroom can verify the source with a map verification and they can directly embed the output to their future production.

Another powerful product is [Fly](http://www.editonthefly.com/) app. It is a video editing application for iOS devices that make fun editing videos in such small screen. Thanks to smart UX solution and good use of multi-touch screen editing the footage has never been so easy. Edityonthefly offers also two other iOs apps, namely [Clips](http://www.editonthefly.com/clips) and [Crop](http://www.editonthefly.com/crop) which allow user to video-edit with a timeline and to crop video footage.
