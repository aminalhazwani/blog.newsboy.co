In a [previous post](http://thesis.aminalhazwani.com/long-good-read/) I talked about the rise of long form journalism. 

After the ground breaking work of the New York Times – namely [Snowfall](http://www.nytimes.com/projects/2012/snow-fall/) – two years ago, I found another award winning project by [NPR](http://www.npr.org/). It is developed by the their [Visual Team](http://blog.apps.npr.org/) and it shows the world behind the making of a t-shirt in five chapters full of videos, graphics and pictures. Last but not least the project was fully financed with a [Kickstarter campaign](https://www.kickstarter.com/projects/planetmoney/planet-money-t-shirt). To view it visit [planetmoney.com/shirt](http://planetmoney.com/shirt).

Something worth to mention is the NPR commitment to sharing the source code of every project on [GitHub](https://github.com/nprapps) providing also instructions on how to run each app on your machine. Chapeau!

Another interesting project is [Hollow](http://hollowdocumentary.com/). The interactive documentary Hollow created by Elaine McMillion is a perfect case to look at the current pros and cons of online storytelling. Unlike a traditional documentary where viewers turn the lights down, sit back and have a story unfold in front of their eyes, participants 'watching' Hollow must scroll and click through a detailed multi-storyline experience that revolves around McDowell County, West Virginia, a poster child region of all that is wrong in America — economic stagnation, dwindling population, high teenage pregnancy rate, staggering statistics on obesity and drug addiction. Despite the apparent hardships, there is a strong sense of community in the residents of McDowell County.[^1] Also Hollow was funded with a [Kickstarter campaign](https://www.kickstarter.com/projects/elainemcmillion/hollow-an-interactive-documentary). 

There are many more projects that have gone in this direction. Long-form stories allow journalists, designers and developers to fully experiment with the content and to bring readers/watchers the most out of a single story or topic. 

Here a short list of what I found:
    - [At the heart of the oil industry: Fort McMoney](http://www.fortmcmoney.com/#/fortmcmoney)
    - [17,000 Islands](http://www.17000islandsinteractive.com/): set in the Indonesian museum park called Beautiful Indonesia Miniature Park — a manicured synopsis of the country’s 17,000 islands — the project explores models of reality by looking at how an image of a nation is created and how documentary filmmaking takes part in this process.
    - [Clouds over Cuba](http://cloudsovercuba.com/) a web-video documentary about the Cuba-USA-URSS mid '60 crisis. They also developed an alternate history after this political crisis. 

There are also several tools that help storytellers layout and animate their stories, such as:
    - [Creatavist](https://www.creatavist.com/)
    - [Microsoft Sway](https://sway.com/) 
    - [Zeega](http://zeega.com/)
