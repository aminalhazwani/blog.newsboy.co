Today I spent a morning at the [#guardiancoffee](http://www.boxpark.co.uk/brand/guardiancoffee/) a brand new, caffeine-infused pop-up destination in the heart of East London’s creative technology community.

The space is really welcoming and every table has its own tablet where you can read the latest news from the Guardian. 

From their website: 

> guardiancoffee aims to bring the Guardian’s groundbreaking open journalism approach to life through direct, real-time engagement with the people who are shaping the future of technology in London. 

This is really interesting from a user experience point of view. The space was something I didn't consider until now. But I realized that it can be easily an important factor in the process of delivering the news.
