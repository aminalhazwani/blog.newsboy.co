summary:    Gamify the reading experience. Make readers compete with each other. Track what they read and what they cover in order to offer a news diet

In the last meeting I had with my relator, Kris Krois, we discussed about a possible gamification approach in order to address the problem of news consumption.

My first thought was to gamify the reading experience making readers compete with each other. How much did you read this week? How many topics did you cover? The answers to these questions could easily declare the best reader of the week.

Based on the each user news consumption you could also suggest a news diet. Do you read a lot about sports? Be careful, reading too much about sport makes you fat!

Apparently at The Daily Beast they embrace this approach and they implemented on their mobile app a reader dashboard where you can see the articles you red, the stories you skipped and the topics you covered. This reading/skipping method helps the Beast algorithm suggest better and better stories to their readers.[^1]

The Daily Beast isn't the only platform that is trying to serve personalized content. Also the New York Times improved its [recommendations engine](http://www.nytimes.com/recommendations) in order to give better suggestions to their readers. Based on your reading history the renew product displays in real time the stories that you might be most interested in.[^2]
