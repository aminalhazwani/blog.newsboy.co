summary:    This is the best time for being a journalist and we've barely begun to reinvent news and media

While I was reading an article from the recenlty launched "Gli Stati Generali" I discovered the figure of [Jeff Jarvis](http://buzzmachine.com/), director of the [Tow-Knight Center for Entrepreneurial Journalism](http://www.towknight.org/). The center runs educational programs, conducts research and supports journalism startups.[^1]

Browsing through their website I looked into their research page and I found out a very very interesting project. It's called "AHA! The Ideation Game for Journalism Innovation" and it's the result of a research done by Nicholas Diakopoulos. In his paper "Unexplored Opportunities in Technology & Journalism]" Nicholas shows the state of art of the relationship between news and technology. He identified 27 computing concepts, among them: social computing, mobile and ubiquitous computing, wearable computing, information visualization, virtual and augmented reality, game engines, robotics, natural language processing, machine learning and translation, speech and activity recognition, and data mining. Next, to set the context for exploration, he identified news consumers' needs (staying informed, personal identity, social interaction, entertainment); journalistic goals (subsets of seeking truth, serving the public interest, and informing the public); and what he calls value-added information processes (e.g., information design, filtering, summarization, currency, reliability).[^2]  

What resulted is that we've barely begun to reinvent news and media. AS Jeff Jarvis states

> this is the best time for being a journalist

because there are several technologies which are not being used by newsrooms and that are just waiting for ideas to come.

As a result, Nicholas, developed a card game to help both journalism students (especially of the entrepreneurial bent) and news organizations imagine new technology-inspired products and services.
