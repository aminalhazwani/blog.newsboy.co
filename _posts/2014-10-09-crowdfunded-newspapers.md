Kickstarter, Indiegogo, Crowdrise, Quirky, Tilt and many more. Crowdfunding isn't the future anymore, it's the present. And what happens when is the reader the source of capital for a newspaper? *De Correspondent* and *Krautreporter* are two – worth to mention – examples that show what happens when is the reader who pays the bills for the jornalist.

#### De Correspondent
![De Correnspondent](/assets/de-correspondent.jpg)
[De Correnspondent](https://decorrespondent.nl/) is a Dutch-language, online journalism platform that focuses on background, analysis, investigative reporting, and the kinds of stories that tend to escape the radar of mainstream media because they do not conform to what is normally understood to be "news".

#### Krautreporter
![Krautporter](/assets/krautreporter.jpg)
[Krautreporter](https://krautreporter.de/das-magazin) is a German-based crowdfunded newspaper. Supporters, readers and writers are all part of the same community and they are all contributing to the development of the platform.

Both platforms share most of their ideals. They are offering news that focus not only on daily basis stories but [aims to uncover deep-lying structures and long-term developments](https://decorrespondent.nl/en). Ad-free is a key point: parterns, subscribers and supporters are the only source of income. They both try to serve alternative ways of doing journalism. In order to accomplish it Krautporter claimed to be in permanent beta. 


#### Blendle
It is not crowdfunded but it makes sense to mention it here and now.
