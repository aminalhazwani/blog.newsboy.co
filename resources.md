#### Crowdfunded newspapers
[DeCorrespondent](https://decorrespondent.nl/en)
De Correspondent is a Dutch-language, online journalism platform that focuses on background, analysis, investigative reporting, and the kinds of stories that tend to escape the radar of mainstream media because they do not conform to what is normally understood to be 'news'.

#### Media-funding projects

[Journalism Grants](http://journalismgrants.org/). At a time when many media organisations face financial constraints, the grant programme aims to better enable media houses to go beyond their usual reporting approaches and thus set a new and distinctive agenda for development coverage.
